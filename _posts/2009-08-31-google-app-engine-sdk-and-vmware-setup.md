VMWare network: bridged

OSX firewall: make sure to allow incoming connections to Python

Start dev_appserver.py manually (not with the GUI) with the following ...

sudo /usr/local/bin/dev_appserver.py -a 192.168.0.50 -p 80 [Path to App]

e.g. sudo /usr/local/bin/dev_appserver.py -a 192.168.0.50 -p 80 newdreamop/

Python (192.168.0.50) and VMWare can now connect to each other.Â  Yay for debugging!
