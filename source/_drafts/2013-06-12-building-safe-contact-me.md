# Background

Since the very beginning of Connect.Me, we wanted to build a way for people to manage their 
connections and messaging channels in a safe, private, and permanent way. .....


SafeConnect.me needs to be fast, works on mobile and web, inexpensive to host, and 
fast to build.

NodeJS was chosen over Ruby for performance and simplicity reasons. I've been playing around 
with Node in weekend experiments, but wanted to build a full product and put it through 
its paces. There's also the big advantage of having the entire product in one 
language: CoffeeScript.



# Architecture

* NodeJS
* Express
** Jade
** Stylus
** CoffeeScript
