principles of the personal data movements

1. publish to your server first
2. data portability
3. granular privacy and control
4. strong convention and contractual binding
5. encryption by default


the personal data movement is being driven by ...

1. a better user experience
2. growing concerns about data ownership and privacy
3. new business models 

this is the exact same thing that happened with web 2.0.
at the onset, people said "there's no way users are going to share their personal 
lives online" followed by "social is a fad" followed by "how can businesses 
make money with this".

we're on the same curve for the personal data movement. there's some early 
resistance to the new business models (the idea that you don't need to own 
your users and their data), but in the end, the better user experience and economic 
potential is so huge that this is unstoppable. the only real question is how
it's all going to unfold. will it be a new startup? a new technology standard?
new government regulations? that ultimately drive everything forward.

what is the economics of users having their own personal data servers online?
i.e. personal clouds?

in the early days of the web, people directly or indirectly paid ISP's to host 
their blogs or websites. the same is still true, even for the social web. 
we indirectly pay facebook to host our pictures and social updates by allowing 
them to use our data to target and display ads to us.

cost of storage and bandwidth are nearly inverse to moores law. so storing someone's
personal data for a small fee or offsetting the fee with advertising or new 
relationship marketing channels is viable.
