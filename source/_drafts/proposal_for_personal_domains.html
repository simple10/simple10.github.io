Even with the rise of two-factor authentication, losing access to your main email account 
can result in disaster.

Gmail, etc. may change policy or you may want to use a different service. Best to have 
a personal domain (e.g. me@me.me) for all your accounts. But what if you loose access to 
your domain because it expires or someone hijacks it?

A better solution would be to allow for a special personal top level domain that is 
really cheap and purchased in 10 year increments with a generous 1 year extension.

Something like .email or .person or .pd (personal domain?).
