GDI startups. You use two-factor authentication. Awesome and thank you.

Now tell me which two-factor method or service you're using when I reset my password.

Every two-factor implementation I've encountered so far fails to show which service 
or app it's using to send me the tocken. Was it a text message? Google Authenticate? 
Authy? Your own app?

I end up on this screen (see DigitalOcean screen shot) and then have to methodically 
go through each possible two-factor token receiver on my phone. It's not a huge deal, 
but it's a massively broken user experience with an incredibly simple fix: just 
tell me where to look for my token.
