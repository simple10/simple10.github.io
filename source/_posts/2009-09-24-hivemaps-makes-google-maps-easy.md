Just released [HiveMaps](http://socialhive.org/hivemaps). An open source JavaScript framework for Google Maps that makes it super easy to put thousands of data points on a map. HiveMaps supports client-side marker clustering, back button, dynamic marker lists, geocoding, embedding, and smart handling of overlapping markers.

HiveMaps currently uses an improved version of [MarkerClusterer](http://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.com/2009/04/markerclusterer-solution-to-too-many.html) available in the [source code repo](http://code.google.com/p/hivemap/source/browse/trunk/js/markerclusterer.js).
