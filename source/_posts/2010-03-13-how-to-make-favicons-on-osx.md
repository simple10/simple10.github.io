Use Fireworks or Photoshop to make the icon PNGs of different sizes. Then use Gimp to create the ico file. [Tutorial](http://egressive.com/tutorial/creating-a-multi-resolution-favicon-including-transparency-with-the-gimp)

Or install a .ico [file plugin](http://www.telegraphics.com.au/sw/) to Photoshop. [Tutorial](http://www.photoshopsupport.com/tutorials/jennifer/favicon.html).
